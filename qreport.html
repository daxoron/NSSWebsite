						<p><b><i><u>WASTE SEGREGATION CAMPAIGN</u>:<br>Date : 22nd - 26th July 2020</i></b></p>
						<blockquote>“Waste segregation is the mother program because the idea of waste segregation is not just waste segregation per se.

We are dumping at our landfills but then at the same time, we still want people to learn how to manage their own garbage. “<br><br>'This is rightly quoted by Frederika Rentoy'</blockquote>
