							<h2>Blood Connect</h2>
							<span class="byline">Veins and Chains</span>
						</header>
						<div>
						</div>
						<p>
You don’t have to be a doctor to save lives. Just donate blood. It’s safe. Its simple. And it saves lives. Keeping this in mind
NSS SPM UNIT in collaboration with blood connect had organised
two competitions under veins and chains.
one was of creative writing and another was of drawing competition.
As we know that blood is the most precious gift that anyone can give to another person- the gift of life.
A decision to donate your blood can save a life, or even several if your blood is separated into its components – red cells, platelets and plasma – which can be used individually for patients with specific conditions.
We got to learn a lot of new things and information through this awareness programs and competitions.
The winners for this was announced on 6th October 2020 in the webinar only. The winners got their sketch on wooden frame from blood connect which was delivered directly to their house. The activity was carried out under the guidance of NSS convenor prof.
Raj Kumar Falwaria and was coordinated by NSS joint secretary Shivani Gupta and student head Anshu Soni. Winners post were featured on official nss Instagram and facebook page.
Students got a chance to show their creative side and do a fun activity in this lockdown.

									<h2>HASTLIPI</h2>

									<span class="byline">(CALLIGRAPHY COMPETITION)</span>
									<br>
						<p>NSS SPM Unit had successfully organised an inter- college Calligraphy
competition "Hastlipi" on the pretext of Gandhi Jayanti for every
college student.
Studies have shown that children retain the spelling of a word much better when they are writing the words out by hand.
So learning calligraphy and handwriting are definitely an incredible way to develop fine motor skills and increase memory retention.
Calligraphy is the art of both ideal writing and an ideal soul.
the topic for the competition was non-violence and swadeshi.
entries were accepted from 30th September 2020 to 1st October
2020. language was bilingual. And e-certificates were provided to top
3 participants. Calligraphy were related to thoughts or quotes of
Mahatma Gandhi on Non-violence and Swadeshi. Limit for the
calligraphy lines were 5-8 lines. only one entry per person were
allowed. After the judgement the winners were Akansha Jha, Shivani and vani.

<h2>MEME SHALA</h2>

<span class="byline">(MEME COMPETITION)</span>
<br>
<p>
	Memes can provide a unique snapshot into the cultural events of a moment in time.
	Some memes rotate for years, while the others live a short , but often explosive life of laughter and knowledge .
	Memes also offers people and companies the opportunity to make a reference to an established inside joke that the entire internet is a part of. Considering these things to be important in a students life the NSS SPM UNIT had successfully organised an Inter - college Meme competition "Memeshala" .
	the topics for the competition were New education Policy, Atma
	Nirbhar Bharat and memes related to college and NSS.
	only one entry per participants was allowed. Language was bilingual
	and there should be no plagiarism. There were 2 rounds in
	memeshala. Result for 1st round was declared on 3rd october on
	whatsapp group. Top 10 were qualified for 2nd round. And after a
	voting session on insta handle of nss the winners were declared.
