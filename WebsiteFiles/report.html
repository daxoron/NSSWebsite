						<p><b><i><u>DELHI TRAFFIC POLICE WALKATHON</u> : [Date : 11th January 2020]</i></b></p>
						<p>The 31st Road Safety Week was observed from 11th January to 17th January 2020. With 356 million young people in the country, India has one of the youngest populations in an aging world. Unfortunately, we are unable to utilize the demographic dividend to its full potential as we are losing our manpower to hopeless road accidents. As per the WHO Global report, road accidents are recognized as the leading cause of deaths among the youth between the ages of 5-29 in India and worldwide. Taking this into consideration, the theme of this year was chosen to be, "Bringing Change Through Youth".</p>
						<p>Delhi Traffic Police organized a Walkathon on the inaugural day of the National Road Safety week on 11th January 2020 at C- Hexagon India Gate. The walk began at 9:00 AM. The NSS Unit of Shyama Prasad Mukherjee College also participated in the walkathon along with other NSS Units from different colleges.</p>
						<p>The objective of the walk was to promote road safety and make citizens aware of the traffic rules and their importance. 40 volunteers from our NSS Unit were part of the walk. College provided the transport to the venue of the walkathon. The volunteers gathered at 9:00 AM to recite slogans on road safety albeit “Save way subway, don’t jump red light, we want to save you”, “Sadak Suraksha, Jeevan Raksha” and more.

						<p><b><i><u>CLOTH DONATION DRIVE</u> : [Date : 15th - 22nd January 2020]</i></b></p>
						<p>Government statistics reveal that winters are the second major reason for deaths in India, after lightning. Floods come third on this list. Statistics show that till 2007, 826 people died every year due to harsh winters in India. The death toll started to increase after 2007 due to a drop in winter temperatures. Between 2002 and 2012, as many as 10,740 people died from exposure to cold and avalanche.</p>
						<p>Every year, more than 200 people die in December itself. A report of the Centre for Holistic Development (CHD) revealed that in the month of December and January this year, 427 people have died due to extreme cold. Clearly, hundreds of winter deaths are considered “normal”, and there is hardly any effort to find the exact reason behind them.</p>
						<p>To relieve unfortunate people from this cause, the NSS Unit of Shyama Prasad Mukherji College for Women organized a cloth donation drive starting from 15th January 2020 till 22nd January 2020.  Cardboard boxes were set up in the area near the resource room for the students and staff to donate helpful and purposive things to those in need. The boxes were set up at 9:30 AM in the morning and the drive continued till 2 PM every day. At the end of the day, the things donated were collected, checked for any wear and tear and properly wrapped up for further delivery.</p>
						<p>The donation drive was organized in collaboration with ‘We Clothe Them', an NGO seeking to empower the less privileged by giving them access to one of the basic needs of survival, i.e., clothing. It is an endeavor to bridge the unequal distribution of resources by collecting surplus clothes from the more privileged sections of society and directing them to people who really needs them through such collaborations.</p>
						<p>The donation drive continued for a week and everyone participated enthusiastically. We had successfully collected clothes weighing up to 8 cardboard boxes. At the end of the drive, the donated items were packed in boxes and delivered to the NGO.</p>
