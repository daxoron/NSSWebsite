						<p>As we all know India is a country of unity in diversity. The mountain ranges, river-irrigated areas, rivers, and streams, forest, and desert all have beautified India with their outstanding diversity amongst people various races, castes, creed, religion, and languages each state and region has its uniqueness International local travelers or visitors love this variety colors, culture, and the climate, etc. Dance & music, colorful festivals and beautiful handiworks a spell on the visitors both National and international. Beaches of Goa, backwaters of Kerala, and snow-clad mountains of Himachal, and sands, & lakes of Rajasthan, world culture sights of Delhi etc are the symbol of the diversity of our nation. This colorful variety of a country makes our country a major attraction of tourists that is beneficial for the Economy, and prosperity of the country. However, many of the differences in religions, traditions, languages and cultures have become so intense that they have assumed dangerous proportions for National Unity and safety. We not only have to provide the best facilities and safety to foreign tourists but also to maintain peaceful and amicable coextensive people belonging to different ethnicities and cultures. Without peace, our diversity is of no use. It is the common duty of the government and the people of India to keep the beautiful diversity of our nation secured in the card of unity intact. The term unity in diversity relates to the state of togetherness or integrity despite the presence of infinite diversity. Unity in diversity is based on the concept where the individual has variations in physical qualities, skin color, castes, creed, cultural and religious traditions, etc. are not seen as a dispute. In India, the national unions only can be the establishment of a strong, unified and prosperous Indian, usually in the days of extremism and terrorism. Mahatma Gandhi sacrificed his life for communal unity. Though, there are different communities like Bengalis, Gujaratis, Punjabis, Maharashtrians, Tamilians, etc. the facts remain that despite divisions and differences, caste or creed, we have lived together for thousands of years. Though, there are differences between the Hindu and the Muslim communities concerning their cultures, ideology, and rituals. They live together and have a deep-rooted respect for each other. The Hindus send greetings to their Muslim friends at the time of their Muslim festivals such as Eid, Muharram, etc. likewise, the Muslims also send wishes or greetings to their Hindu friends at the time of Hindu festivals such as Diwali, Durga puja, etc. this describes the majority of unity among the Hindus and the Muslims in India. The term unity of diversity signifies the unity between people with different cultural, religious faiths, social status and other demographic variations. This expression has its organizations, since ancient times, it is used by various political and social assemblies to show unity among the individuals or societies. This is an ancient expression that was earlier used by some societies in North America and China, around 500 BC. Unity in India is the best model of unity in diversity because people living with various religions and cultures follow the same laws as laid down by the Constitution of India. India has seen the cultural history of experiments creating new forms, the diversity of which can be felt in terms of the number of cultural, religious, linguistic, functional units and political parties. These differences can easily be attributed simply to previous years of migration, exchange, initiation and comparison and the separation of natural boundaries. The transition period and in the current situation with a population of about 1.33 million. India introduces a border of different cultures and traditions, we see the rise of faith, from prehistoric times to the Vedic period. Although it was present at the adoption of this form, it differed from region to region, and sometimes when the Aryans arrived, different tribal societies had different values and different metals of the same values giving the same heritage for several generations. Hierarchical systems were widely known, they differed from region to region. Hindus, therefore, appear not only as a religion but as a single view of different practices. As well as the migration of other strong religious communities in India, especially the long-standing Islam and Christianity in India. Cultural integration and doctrinal growth, the development of tolerance and solidarity in India. Religions such as Judaism from around the world were bound in small pockets in the Indian subcontinent. Unity in diversity instructs us that although we are from diverse caste, creed or race, these variations cannot keep us apart and we are eternally united for the improvement of our nation. This is the most uncommon event which is exposed in our country. It not only performs the nation united and strengthened but it also holds us alive in the old eras, the belief of co-existence with love, peace, and respect. The distinction in culture, traditions, festivals, music and dance makes the country energetic and makes an unbelievable country in the world.</p>
