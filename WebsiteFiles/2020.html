<p><b>YEAR 2020</b>, the most unique year in modern human history. What a year it has been,
from pandemic to the wildlife fires in california, have never been seen before or atleast
not to this level.The year 2020 tests any belief in the good life. It is a time of pestilence
and ash, of state murder and revolt, of alienation and disruption. After several months,
some are still wishing it would magically end. We wonder, can't we just hit pause on the
progress of life until this outbreak has wound its way out of our systems.It is natural to
say that this year is a cursed one. Problems faced globally by humans in 2020 due to the
pandemic are climate action failure, biodiversity loss, human made environmental
disasters that is natural disasters(storms,floods,earthquakes), forest fire and blasts,
extreme weather and water crisis. A stretch of bad events kicked of the year as the
deadly explosion in Beirut ,atleast 157 people were killed ,over 6000 injured ,and
hundreds and thousands were displaced.There was social unrest everywhere,following
the killing of George Floyd in USA due to Racial injustice and police brutuality.This year
also witnessed violence in india's capital Delhi(in Shaheen Bagh) which has left more
than 50 dead and hundreds injured after a Hindu nationalist rampage and many more.</p>
<ul><li><b>Lockdown:</b></li><p>We all have witnessed world's biggest lockdown.First of all lockdown, I
have heard the term curfew and saw that hapening too but i was completely unaware
of the term Lockdown and we also came across terms like "Quarantine" and "social
distancing"."this is a pandemic experience that's unique in the lifetime of every single
person on earth",says Sten Vermund. The staggering fall in its Gross Domestic
Product (GDP) growth, which was already in a slowdown before the pandemic,
reflected the total suspension of economic activity in the first quarter of this fiscal
due to the series of lockdowns to stem the spread of virus.Millions of people have
lost jobs in the formal sector since lockdown due to the eonomic stress cause by the
pandemic.India's rate of jobless growth had emerged as a top concern among
economist.But still humans managed it well.The impact of pandemic observed in
every sector around the world. The education sectors of India as well as world are
badly affected by this. It has enforced the world wide lock down creating very bad
effect on the students life,this was the first time when schools and educational
institutions remained closed for this much longer period. The education sector has
been fighting to survive the crises with a different approach they switch to virtual
learning is a different skill-set for teachers and for students, and student success
now kind of depends on if their learning style meshes well with the self-directedness
of online learning.</p>
<p>From doctors, lab technicians and ASHA workers, who have been at the forefront of the
battle against the coronavirus disease, to members from the police force that played a
crucial role in the enforcement of lockdown restrictions,our goverment they worked alot
for us at the time of crisis.These healthcare workers balance the Covid-19 pandemic
between their family and patient they know that having the highest risk of disease any
left from there and can put duty as there moral and social responsibilities to treat their
patients we can only imagine the stress they must be facing dealing with horrible
situation.And even India developed themselves in so many fields such as nature
changes, Unity among people, River restoration programme, for employement, in this
year ISRO did most of the developments.<br>
Some have lost a loved one to pandemic.Others have faced severe restrictions due to
the lockdown or quarantine. There are harrowing stories emerging of some who are
unable to cope as they are cooped up in their homes.<br>
If i discuss about my experience so from 2020's starting,i had virtually isolated myself
to prepare for the Class 12 board exams in March but after ending of my exams i get to
know about the nationwide lockdown because of the Coronavirus pandemic has,
however, thrown all my plans into disarray and left me deeply worried.But this period
came as a blessing for me, as every member of my family is at home and we all are
spending time together, after a very long time.And also with regular revision and staying
upto date with news, I am completing a number of series which I left in December due to
my board exams or as I wake up every morning, I check the number of positive cases,
While it is no surprise of how haunting the numbers look, I still declare them at home
only to see the worry and fear drawn on their faces.Watching netflix, reading books,
cooking and eating, etc things i did in lockdown.I also started learning about language
"french" during lockdown. But However, experiencing the lockdown life, I realize the
importance of social interaction, after all it is what makes us human."Enquire, Engage,
Explore, eat",this is my regular routine during whole lockdown.Hence,For me living in
lockdown has given me time to reflect on ourselves and our relationships many people
found meaning and connections with young or adult children ,older Relatives and other
mates, it reconnected us with family and friends,it also effect positively on mental health
it prevented us away from things like the depression and hypertension, overthinking and
provided time for self realisation.</p>
<ul><li><b>Conclusion:</b></li><p>We should never take the life and the things that are provided with for granted, staying
grateful to the life is not only a gesture of gratitude but also an attitude to acknowledge
that we are very small and our aspirations should not harm this mother earth in any way.
Staying happy is no less important than living an inspirational and prosperous life. I
expect from this upcoming year "2021" is first of all health may this year be healthy for
all and recover those who had lost their loved ones.Development of our
country,worldwide Quality of Education should improve for all sections, Environment
maintain the greenery level and should improve day by day, Society should be filled with
feeling of harmony and brotherhood to help those who need any time, People can travel
freely all over the world without any restrain, Media should discuss topics like
Censorship, Political correctness and freedom of speech. People can go to their work
place without any barrier and can increase their productivity and efficiency.</p></ul>

<p><b>2020: THE YEAR OF SENSATION AND INNOVATION</b></p> 						
<p>The world is enveloped in a global health emergency that is exacting enormous medical and economic tolls upon humanity. The year of 2020 had left the people frivolous for almost a span of 2-3 months. The year had started with a sprinkle of excitement, nervousness, eagerness, anticipation and enthusiasm for the students like us who were at the brink of their school life. Starting with the practicals, moving to the farewell and then to the final destination of schooling, i.e. the 12th class board examinations. The best moments of the student life were going to be over. We all were hot blooded for one or the other reason. The nervousness of exams, result; the excitement of being a student of one of the prestigious colleges in near future had all been left open-ended. Open-ended because everything then was at halt. Examinations were left in between; people were to stick to their homes; overall the life of each and every people was given a break; a break of 68 days-the lockdown. The students were not conspicuous for their remaining exams; the laymen were awaiting for the work to restart; everyone was in dilemma, just pondering over what to do then.<br>
“STAY HOME, STAY SAFE”, the slogan that has been hovering over our ears since the last year. The period of lockdown irrespective of the indolence it created, opened the window of opportunity to all to give time to their hobbies. We all were ready to give time to what we had forgotten in the near past, our hobbies, mine is sketching and cooking, what’s yours. I have learnt a little baking and it was an amazing experience of my life of lockdown. Giving time to sketching is my most loved activity during interstices, I would ever prefer to. Sketching the cute faces, still life, sceneries were really the moments of pleasure for me. The year 2020 gave us the time to be with the ones whom we love or the ones by whom we are loved. It also had come with a lot of mysteries. Rather, it had given us some shocking news too. The news of the passing away of great personalities had really saddened me to a great depth. We had lost our great ministers in the year, the former President Pranab Mukherjee, Food and Consumer Affairs Minister Ram Vilas Paswan and others. The deaths of celebrities included several film stars, music industrialists, dance choreographer and the corona fighters. Soumitra Chatterjee; SP Balasubrahmanyam; the dance choreographer Saroj Khan; the legendary actor Irrfan Khan; Rishi Kapoor, the third-generation actor of the family; Bollywood star Sushant Singh Rajput and others had left this world in the 2020. The death of Sushant Singh Rajput was a thunderbolt for most of the population. His death brought forward the trap of nepotism being spread in Bollywood.
Nevertheless, the year had brought severe depression, it has set an example for the population to change its habit of exploiting the nature and its components. We have always fought against each of our enemy with the same courage and enthusiasm.<br>The religious beliefs and spirituality of people have helped them to fight against the greatest foe of the present world, i.e. the COVID-19. Although it has left dreadful impacts yet the pandemic has taught us divergent human values. The strenuous time of pandemic has given us a lesson that there is always a way to every problem but the condition is that we shouldn’t lose hope in our life, even if we are in a burdensome situation. In this world, nothing is permanent not even life. We should not stress ourselves too much because no matter how bad the situation is, it will change. This tough time of pandemic and lockdown has also taught us to respect the freedom that we have in the today’s time because “Freedom cannot be bestowed-it must be achieved”.
